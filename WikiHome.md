Currently, this wiki is only used to map out the project's goals and ideas, as they come to us. Eventually, this will become more documentation and less daydreaming.


## About MSC Assets ##
MSC Assets is (or at least will be) a web-based application used to inventory tangible and/or fixed assets. For each asset, it records identifiable information (serial numbers, asset tags, model numbers), accounting information (costs, date of service, MACRS method), and organizational information (department, campus/location).

While these tasks are performed by plenty of other applications out there already, none offer the simplicity of a dedicated application. Our goal is a simple, easy-to-use application that makes data entry fast and reporting useful without the overhead of managing/maintaining a robust CRM, accounting package, or similar tool.

### Origins ###
MSC Assets is being developed by and for [Milestone Church](http://www.milestonechurch.com) thanks to the assistance of its talented volunteers. Our hope is that by making open source (MIT License), others can benefit from and/or contribute to our efforts.
