#summary This page outlines the development punchlist and notes related to Categories.

----

==Add==
_Fields:_
 * Parent - _listed as a `<select>` with a hierarchy (by means of CSS, not characters) of existing Categories, along with a 'Top Level' option_
 * Name

----

==Edit==
_Fields:_
 * Parent - _same as above_
 * Name
This page should mention that changing the Parent also changes the children accordingly.

----

==Delete==
This page should check for existing child Categories, and display an error if some exist, along with a link to the appropriate Categories.
`You cannot delete this Category until its child Categories are placed under a different parent.`

It should also check for existing mapped [Assets], and display the appropriate error if some are found.

----

==List==
Only [#Super_Admin Super Admins] should be able to view the full list of Categories.

_Links:_

Each list item should link to the appropriate [Assets#List Asset List].

_Precision:_

The Category lists should be able to be focused on a single [Locations Location], [Departments Department].

----

==View==
The view page for Categories should display counts for [Departments]/[Assets] mapped to the given Category, along with combined [Assets Asset] values.

The page should be presented in a manner to communicate the context (parent/children) of the focused Category with the ability to navigate accordingly.
