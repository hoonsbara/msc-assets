#summary This page outlines the development punchlist and notes related to Departments.

==Add==
====Fields====
 * [Location]
 * Name

Once the Department is created, a link to the [Categories#Assign Assign Categories] page should be displayed prominently to remind admins to set them up if needed.

==Edit==
====Fields====
 * [Location]? 
  I'm still wondering if we should make this even possible. Is there any justification for it?
 * Name

==Delete==
This page should check for existing [Assets] mapped to this Department, and display an error if some exist, along with a link to the appropriate mapped assets.

{{{
You cannot delete this Department until <a href='whatever'>these 5 Assets</a> are mapped to another Department.
}}}

==List==
If the user is a [Users#SuperAdmin SuperAdmin], display a list of all Departments grouped by [Locations Location]. Else, if the user is a [Users#LocationAdmin LocationAdmin] of one or more [Locations], display a list of all Departments in the appropriate [Locations], grouped by [Locations Location]. Else, display a list of departments mapped to the user.

====Precision====
The Department lists should be able to be focused on a single [Locations Location] or a single [Categories Category].

==View==
The view page for departments should display counts of mapped users and assets, as well as a summary of asset values.
