Using PHP/MySQL, this small web application logs basic identificaton and accounting information for tangible (fixed) assets. Once data is entered, reports should be available by department and location (in the case of multi-campus organizations).

This is still a brand new project, and probably can't/shouldn't be used by anyone for anything in its current form.

Visit the [Wiki Page](WikiHome.md) for an outline of the project's goals and plans.
